State
-----

This package provides a solution of adding state to the application. Since this application's binary is meant to be used as a command-line tool to perform actions non-interactively (i.e. one command at a time), state can't really be stored in memory. However, in some cases, keeping track of some background information, e.g. the period you're working with, allows simplifying the executed commands. For this reason, a [lockedfile](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/lockedfile) (which is definitely so overkill but whatever) is provided to allow keeping track of relevant state.

One of the helpers provided by the state package is the `GetValidPeriod()` function. The casheer cli only allows managing one period at a time, consisting of a year and a month. This is the intended functionality of the application, to avoid cluttering me with past (or future) details when working on my expenses. The function ensures to always retrieve a valid period which is either the current period, or the period set in the state file. I'll likely add a more advanced manager which will allow navigating through multiple periods simultaneously if I ever get drunk and bored (I'll never need that).
